# py_BasicFormTemplate_UI
GUI sample using Tkinter in Python


 I made it for use on the go. Built because GUI is required separately from the original logic.  
It may not be enough as a GUI sample using tkinter in Python, but I think it is necessary and sufficient.  
I hope this will help you build a GUI for your form app.  
Please customize it appropriately. There may already be a good one, but for reference. .. ..
