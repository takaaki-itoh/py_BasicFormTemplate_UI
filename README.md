# py_BasicFormTemplate_UI
GUI sample using Tkinter in Python

## Minimal form GUI using tkinter in Python  

  It is the minimum necessary, but I created it with the hope that it will help the construction.  
Personally, I created it because I needed it so that I could concentrate on implementing the original logic when building on the go.  
Please customize and use by yourself. There may already be a good one. .. ..
